	<span style="font-family:&quot;">Data about your customers and prospects, the raw material
to sell smarter, already exists in immense quantities both inside and outside
your organization. Integrating these external sources (e.g., Experian, LexisNexis,
and public records and social media) and internal databases (e.g., customer
purchase history, customer service calls, website visits) can be a formidable
challenge. Distilling raw data into ongoing, account-specific insight may seem
unattainable.</span>
