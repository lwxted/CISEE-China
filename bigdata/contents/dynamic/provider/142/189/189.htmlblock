<span style="font-size:14px;">"Summly
 came to SRI International with a core concept to solve the information 
overload problem, which is especially challenging for mobile devices 
because of their limited screen size," said David Israel, Ph.D., program
 director in the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International. 
"Building on SRI's expertise in machine learning and natural language 
processing, the Summly team is creating a new type of content, providing
 understandable and relevant summaries tailored for mobile devices."</span>
